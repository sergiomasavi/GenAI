    "## 1. LangChain and LCEL Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangChain** is a comprehensive framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs), providing abstractions for prompt management, chain composition, and integration with external data sources and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** is a declarative syntax for composing LangChain components into execution chains using the pipe operator (`|`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain Composition**: Sequential component execution through standardized interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | model | parser\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runnable Interface**: Common protocol for all LangChain components enabling interoperability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Template-Based Prompts**: Dynamic prompt generation with variable substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "### LCEL Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit | Implementation |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Streaming** | Real-time response generation | Automatic chunked output |\n",
    "| **Async Support** | Concurrent execution | Native async/await compatibility |\n",
    "| **Batch Processing** | Multiple input handling | Vectorized operations |\n",
    "| **Parallelization** | Performance optimization | Automatic dependency resolution |\n",
    "| **Logging** | Observability | Built-in execution tracing |\n",
    "| **Fallbacks** | Error resilience | Alternative execution paths |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional LLM applications face several challenges:\n",
    "- **Prompt Management**: Hard-coded prompts, difficult versioning\n",
    "- **Component Integration**: Manual wiring between different services\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Limited resilience and retry mechanisms\n",
    "- **Observability**: Poor visibility into execution flow\n",
    "- **Scalability**: No built-in support for async or batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain + LCEL solutions:\n",
    "- Standardized component interfaces through Runnable protocol\n",
    "- Declarative chain composition with automatic optimization\n",
    "- Built-in error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms\n",
    "- Comprehensive logging and tracing capabilities\n",
    "- Native support for streaming, async, and batch operations\n",
