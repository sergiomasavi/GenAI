    "\n",
    "**ReAct** = **Rea**soning + **Act**ing\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct is a framework where an AI agent alternates between **thinking** (reasoning) and **doing** (acting) to solve tasks. Instead of trying to answer a question in one shot, the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thinks** about what it needs to do\n",
    "2. **Acts** by using a tool or taking an action\n",
    "3. **Observes** the result of that action\n",
    "4. **Repeats** this cycle until it has enough information to answer\n",

    "**The ReAct Workflow (Cyclical)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is ReAct Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem with direct prompting**: LLMs don't have access to real-time information or external tools. If you ask \"What's the price of 2 apples and 3 bananas?\", the model:\n",
    "- Doesn't know current prices\n",
    "- Can't do reliable math\n",
    "- Might hallucinate an answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution with ReAct**: The agent can:\n",
    "- **Reason**: \"I need to get the price of apples and bananas\"\n",
    "- **Act**: Call `get_fruit_price` tool\n",
    "- **Observe**: Receive actual prices\n",
    "- **Reason**: \"Now I can calculate the total\"\n",
    "- **Act**: Call `calculate_total_price` tool\n",
